##### A little about myself
As mentioned before in my previous blog posts, I am a code newbie with just over 2 months of experience in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I am currently playing around with ReactJS by following "The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)" course by [Andrew Mead](https://twitter.com/andrew_j_mead) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/).


I have come across a few people on Twitter who were having difficulties staying motivated to learn programming. While with some people programming or coding just clicks, for others like me, we just need to push ourselves a little further to proper get into it. I would like to share my thoughts and experience of the last two months and how I came this far and what you can do as a code newbie to stay motivated. 


#### 1. Commit to 100DaysOfCode challenge
Committing to the 100DaysofCode challenge will allow you to stay on track, meet people with the same level of experience as you and receive help whenever necessary. But most important of all, you will start to realise you are not alone in this. This is a feeling I had to keep fighting because I thought being 27 is way to late to start programming as my husband [Foysal](https://foysal.it) wrote his first line of code when he was 19 and now he is 27 with 8 years of experience. But if you surround yourself with people who are also committed to the same challenge, you will realise people of all ages are learning how to code and it's never too late. I am currently on my 49th day and as soon I finish my first round I am hoping to start a second because I really feel like it just keeps me going! 

#### 2. Reduce procrastination
I have come across people who looks for excuses to delay their learning process. Some of the scenarios are like the followings: 
- I will start on New Year
- I will start on my Birthday 
- I wil start from the beginning of the month <br/>

By the time the day of your choice arrives you are more likely to loose motivation than gain it. So I highly recommend you to just start, its as simple as that! Whether you are planning to change your career or look for a job in this sector, today is the day to start learning, not tomorrow, not on your birthday, not in the beginning of the month! It's Today! So let's get going! 

#### 3. Improve time management
You may have a part-time/full-time job, university, kids, cooking, chores or other things to do in your day to day life and that's okay. Try to live your day to day life, so that coding doesn't start to bother you! In the very beginning, do little but stay consistent. The way I am currently learning is by coding for 2-3 hours max. I try not to overwhelm myself with too much information at once. Instead I make sure I write at least a few lines of code everyday without any break instead of working for a longer period within a day and end up taking a break the next day. This way the information I receive from tutorials stay short and memorable. 

#### 4. Apply to jobs
I don't have a job yet but I am constantly applying and I believe you should do the same even if you are not ready yet. Applying to jobs at an early stage was highly recommended by an author in an article I was reading through once. Sure, you/I are more likely to get rejected than to get hired but at least we get to learn the process of applying as early as possible. Also we both think that we don't know enough to apply to jobs just yet but once we do know enough, it's not like we will land on a job within a week. So why not apply as early as possible and learn both the language and process of job application simultaneously!

#### 5. Join Meetups
I know, I know! We are very shy and we hate meeting people and talking to them about languages we just have basic ideas on which makes it even harder but I believe this will extremely come in handy specially when it comes to our first job. A word of mouth always gets you a quicker job than applying online. But that is not the only advantage! We also get to meet people with similar experience as ours, discuss about our projects and most of all make new friends in our local area. 

#### 6. Write Blogs 
This is what I am doing right now! I am feeling like everything I have written so far in this post might be useless and wouldn't help anyone but I am still here writing about it. I have been coding for over two months and I have already received a few emails from companies asking me if I am interested in a certain position. And one of them was actually quite famous and my husband was extremely jealous that I received an email from them. Unfortunately the position is on-site and I will not be able to relocate at the moment but the first thing they mentioned when they reached out was "hey I have read your blogs on dev.to....." and that gave me a huge confidence boost so I decided to write more blog posts and would ask you to do the same! 

#### 7. Be active on Twitter 
Of course within a certain limit so that you don't get carried away. Follow experienced developers as well as developers that are currently learning just like you. If you come across anything that's interesting to you or you have learnt something new from someone's post, make sure you let them know by leaving a comment every once in a while, which can be a starting point to make friends with someone. Don't be afraid to send them a personal message asking more about the current projects they are working on and if they would like to stay in contact. YES! I know it gets awkward at times but that's just how it is! 

Now I possibly wouldn't have put this as a point unless I have made a very good friend through Twitter. On November 7th, 2019 [Mikey](https://twitter.com/CodingDive) sent me a message asking if we should start our 100DaysOfcode challenge together. I was in vacation in Denmark back then so I asked if he would mind waiting until 18th as I will be back from vacation on 17th Nov, 2019. So we started the challenge together straight away on 18th! Now this was unexpected but me and foysal had to go to Frankfurt in December and Mikey happens to be living only an hour away from Frankfurt so we planned for a get together and he was kind enough to come to frankfurt to meet both of us. Right now we are extremely good friends and we share our knowledge about food, country, culture, religion, programming all the time, which is Amazing.


Now that is all from me today and what I am doing currently on my day to day life. How about you? What are you doing to improve your chances of becoming a successful developer?
