title: "Day 8 - CSS Grid"
---

I have finished the "CSS Grid" course on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/suborna) and played a game called [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) to understand the concept better. I have also watched a tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o) on CSS grid layout and read up the documentation done by [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) which has a very clear demonstration of what CSS grid is and how it works.
