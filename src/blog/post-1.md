Hello everyone,

Today is Monday, 17th of November 2019. A perfectly rainy and a cosy day to start the #100DaysOfCode challenge that was originally created by <a href="https://twitter.com/ka11away?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Alexander Kallaway.</a> If you are interested, you can read more about the creator and the history behind #100DaysOfCode <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/" target ="_blank">here</a>.

# So who am I?


I am a 27 year old female who has done Bachelors in Biomedical Science (BMS) and masters in Haematology & Transfusion Science (basically the study of diseases related to blood) from Middlesex University, London. Besides studying, I started learning Photoshop back in 2012 or 2013 as a hobby. First I started playing around with the options, tools and layers followed by filters & layer styles. Learned how to create amazing text effects by following step by step tutorials from Youtube and then started designing BDGEEKS using Photoshop which I will explain in details in the next section. Currently changing my career from BMS to UI/UX design and also learning how to code. 

# why the change in career? 

So you may wonder if I have studied Biomedical Science, then why did I change my career into UI/UX design. The story is long but the short answer is **Flexibility** & **Freedom**. Career in my chosen field made me feel extremely restrained as I had to be physically present in every interviews, work day/night shifts in a freezing room temperature and follow standard dress code. 

# And why particularly UI/UX? 

To answer this I have to go back to 2011, when my awfully smart husband: [Foysal Ahamed](https://foysal.it/) first started learning how to code. After sometime of learning the basics, he built a website on his own called BDGEEKS in 2013 where he would upload programming related tutorials in Bengali but he did not line the interface of the website. This is where I jumped in and helped him out by trying to design a website for him. And guys check out this masterpiece I have built for him back in 2013:

After that, he continued learning, building and working on projects while I moved onto product designing. I uploaded a few business cards and brochures from 2013 to 2014 [Graphic River](https://graphicriver.net/user/hexkode/portfolio). And again all of this was just out of curiosity and time pass. I did not have any intention of making this a career back then. In 2015, I got caught up with the thesis, coursework and exams of my final year of bachelors. 

[Foysal](https://www.codementor.io/foysalit) then moved into mobile app development and together we have built [Jarme](https://jarmemori.es): a colourful diary app and [Naao](https:naao.delivery): a crowdsourced package delivery app both of which are currently available on Android and iOS. I really enjoyed working on both of this projects with Foysal and it finally made me realise that this is something I want to build my career on. 

# The reason behind learning to code

When designing Jarme and Naao I have realised that my lack of knowledge in what can and can't be built with a programming language was making it extremely difficult for Foysal to build the apps especially Jarme. My design for Jarme was inconsistent and did not follow any design system library. I was also designing components that were a bit unrealistic in terms of programming and even if there was a time consuming way of coding it, the app would end up buggy and slow. Foysal and I were arguing a lot as I was in the impression that he was not liking my designs while in reality the designs were actually very unrealistic to begin with. Hence why I have decided to learn more about programming which will improve my design thinking a lot more and reduce the conflict between the designer and the developer.

# So what have I learnt today? 

The blog section of my portfolio did not exist till today. With a lot of help from Foysal and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), I have finally got it up and running.
