title: "Day 21 - VS Code Shortcuts"
---

As a codeNewBie I realised the importance of shortcuts as soon as I started programming. Shortcuts will not only allow you to code quicker but will also help you stay on your keyboard instead of reaching out to your mouse, which at times may start getting annoying. If you are a codeNewBie I would highly suggest you to learn the following shortcuts: 

>***Note: This post is for Mac users only. Let me know if you would like a windows version and I would be happy to create one.***

### Mac [⌘]
You should know the following shortcuts regardless of whether you are learning how to code or not. These shortcuts work everywhere and not particular to VS Code.  

- **⌘ A** - Select All
- **⌘ C** - Copy
- **⌘ V** - Paste
- **⌘ S** - Save current file
- **⌘ Z** - Undo last action
- **⌘ O** - Open file
- **⌘ W** - Close window/tab
- **⌘ F** - Search for keywords on your current document

As soon as I open my VS code editor I always try to make sure I practice the following shortcuts to write code.

- **⌘ B** - Sidebar open/close
- **⌘ N** - Open new tab
- **⌘ L** - Selects an entire line
- **⌘ X** - Cut line (copies the line and removes it)
- **⌘ .** - Quick Fix [Suggests spelling correction if code spell checker plugin is installed]
- **⌘ ←** - The beginning of a line
- **⌘ →** - The end of a line  
- **⌘ ↑** - The beginning of the file
- **⌘ ↓** - The end of the file
- **⌘ Tab** - Move from one window to another window
- **⌘ \** - Split the code editor

#### Mac [Mixed]

- **⇧ + G** - Go to line (e.g. 6, would take you to line 6 of your code file)
- **⇧ + ⌘ + K**  - Delete an entire line
- **⌥↓ / ⌥↑** - Move line up/down
- **⌥ + click** - Create multiple cursors
- **⌘ + ⇧ + T** - Opens the last tab you closed
- **⇧ + ←/→** - Select each character right or left 
- **⇧ + ←/→** - Select each word right or left
- **⇧ + ⌘ + Z** - Undo last action
- **⌘ + ⇧ + P** - Opens command palette

These are all I can remember on the top of my head at the moment but if you have any other recommendations or useful shortcut suggestions please let me know.
