title: "Day 21 - VS Code Shortcuts for code newbies [mac/windows]"
---

As a codeNewBie I realised the importance of shortcuts as soon as I started programming. Shortcuts not only allowed me to code quicker but it also helped me stay on my keyboard instead of reaching out to my mouse every time, which at times does start to get annoying. If you are a codeNewBie like me then I would highly suggest you to learn the shortcuts below: 


### Basic shortcuts
You should know the following shortcuts regardless of whether you are learning how to code or not. These shortcuts work everywhere and not particular to VS Code.
