          <h3 className="major">The history behind Jarme</h3>
          <p>
          Me and my husband were in a long distance relationship for quite some 
          time until to tied the knot  in November 2016. He was in Italy and I 
          was in UK so we could barely afford to meet each other. But the time 
          we managed to spend together was extremely precious which is why we 
          wanted to keep a memory of every single thing we did together, so we 
          started looking for diary apps on play store. But the apps that were 
          available back then was not very colourful or eye catching and didn’t 
          have all the features we wanted, which is why we decided to build 
          our own diary app. With my husband’s web development experience and 
          my designing skills, we started designing the app in May 2016.

          <h3 className="major">Why is Jarme called Jarme?</h3>
          <p>
            So it was our something (don't remember because we didn't have Jarme 
            back then haha) anniversary coming up and I decided to surprise him 
            by writting a few memories in pieces of papers and putting them in a jar.
            But I realised we have a lot of memories together but don't remember the 
            specifics of it such as date, time or location. This was also another 
            reason why we decided to build Jarme and also where the name come from. 
            Jarme is short for Jar Memories!
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="major">Okay so now lets talk about the design.....</h2>
          <h3 className="major">Design tools</h3>
          <p>
            Initially back in 2016, I designed Jarme using Photoshop. But I soon realised
            that Photoshop is not very suitable for UI/UX designing, which is why I moved
            into Sketch which is more of a UI/UX design oriented software. Now, there are 
            a few reasons why I chose Sketch and one of them was because of its clean 
            interface and the ease of use. But moving from a heavy software like Photoshop
            to a simpler version took some time to get used to. 
          </p>
          <p>Software used: Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator & Adobe After Effects</p>
          <h3 className="major">Sketch Plugins</h3> 
          <div className="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<p>Sketch is an extremely simple design tool that only contains the basic features that 
                  are necessary to get started with the design. However, the whole design process requires 
                  a few plugins that can make any designer's life a lot easier and time effective.  
                  Here are the following plugins I have used while designing Jarme:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Find & Replace</li>
									<li>Icon Font</li>
									<li>Lorem Ipsum </li>
                  <li>Craft</li>
                  <li>Prism</li>
                  <li>Icon Font</li>
								</ul> 
          </div>
          <h3 className="major">Font choice</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to choosing a font for Jarme, Google fonts has always been my first choice. One of 
            the main advantage of using Google font is that, its completely FREE for anyone to use with over 680 
            font families to choose from. Google fonts also do not require any licencing meaning the fonts can 
            be used for personal and commercial purposes with no restriction whatsoever. <br/> 
          </p>
          <p>Jarme font: Roboto </p>
          <h3 className="major">Icons</h3>
          <p>
            Jarme was developed using Ionic framework hence the icon choice was also from the Ionic provided Ionicons.
            These icons were extremely easy to play around with as they can be easily downloaded as font through Icon
            font plugin.  <br/> 
          </p>
          <p>Icon Choice: Ionicons </p>
